Well it has been a long time since we have release out last version of the software. This is mainly due to time.

As you may already know, this software is written and developed in my spare time. Over the past year, I have been spending my spare time in the forum and also developing myitcrm2, hence why it has been along time since that last release.

I would also like to say a big thanks to all of you who have donated to myitcrm of the past year, it has helped cover the hosting costs. We have also been using digitalocean VPS to host the ruby demo which has been running now for several months and I am very impressed with the service. Thankyou Digitalocean for the great service!

MyITCRM2 is still in a alpha stage with more features being added all the time to make it extremely usable and suitable for all types of businesses.

For those interested, you can check out the latest code demo at http://ruby2.myitcrm.com/
